1.Team Formation
2.Topic Selection
3.Creating Project Synopsys
4.Requirement Gathering
5.Coding or Implementation
6.Testing
7.Project Presentation
8.Writing a Research Paper
Let us look into the steps one by one.

Step 1- Team Formation Phase: Creating a Dynamic Team
Team formation for a final year project is a crucial aspect that can significantly impact the success and efficiency of the project. In the final year, students often have diverse academic backgrounds, skills, and interests. Therefore, forming a well-balanced team becomes essential to leverage the strengths of each member and address any potential weaknesses.
